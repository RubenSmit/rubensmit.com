Steal the show on the dance-floor with these LED corsages that sync their colors and animations.

The corsage consists of a ESP8266 with a small Neopixel ring and two buttons. The buttons can be used to change the
color and animation mode of the corsage. These settings are transmitted via ESP-NOW to another corsage so their color
and animation modes are synced. The PCB design is meant to be worn on a suit or dress. A battery management chip and a
lipo battery can be attached to the back to make it portable. This amounts to about 25 grams, light enough to be held by
magnets or a clip.

Check out the [documentation](https://github.com/RubenSmit/corsage) on how you can make one yourself.
