This installation, created for the Gogbot festival as part of the study Creative Technology at the University of
Twente, is a mirror, but not a regular one. When you look into the mirror you don't see yourself, your reflection is
different. Your reflection will be how we think humans will look like when they move to mars and adapt to their
environment.

At first people will be attracted by the fact that their reflection is different. They will be amazed by the fact that
the expressions of the reflection are equal to theirs. They might start wondering why the reflection looks this way. We
wanted to give the visitors a simple interaction. A mirror is the most simple interaction we could think of. You don't
have to press any buttons or complete any tasks. People are used to seeing their reflection, and when your reflection is
different from what you expect it is very funny.
