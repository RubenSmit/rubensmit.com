For a project Bouke Regnerus and I had to make an instrument, we came up with the idea to make a Sequencer capable of
sending MIDI data to a MIDI player. This sequencer or launchpad can be used to play music files or act as a MIDI
instrument. Using the custom software you can preview the currently playing sequence.

It is possible to connect the Sequencer to any software capable of recieving MIDI commands. With the function buttons it
is even possible to control multiple instruments or decks of instruments. With the dials the speed and pitch can be
adjusted.

Want to make one yourself or interested in how it works? View
the [documentation](https://www.instructables.com/Launchpad-Sequencer-with-MIDI-output/) for detailed instructions.
