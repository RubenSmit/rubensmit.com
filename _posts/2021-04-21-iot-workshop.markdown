As an activity for our student association during the Covid lockdowns we organized an IOT workshop where the
participants would create a LED ring light. The goal of the workshop was to provide the participants with some basic
knowledge about embedded electronics and programming. The project could be used as a steppingstone for further
exploration into the IOT field.

To achieve this we created an extensive manual detailing on how to assemble the hardware and put it into an enclosure.
Next it described how to program and load the software. We also described some alternate projects that could be achieved
using the hardware we provided. We tried to give some background for each step so the participants could also gain some
in depth understanding. The full manual we created can be found on the [C.S.V. Alpha IOT workshop website](
